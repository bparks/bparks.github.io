title: Pails
---
<p>Pails is:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Minimalist</strong> - the goal has been to write as little code as possible, but to make it the most
        powerful code that performs the tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong> - everything is an object, except for the very smallest bits of bootstrapping
        code</li>
    <li><strong>MVC</strong> - there are no rules in pails, only conventions. The strongest of these is the MVC design
        architecture</li>
    <li><strong>Infinitely-extensible</strong> - aside from the several existing plugins, pails is a web application
        development framework, so you can either build plugins for it or build your app directly on the MVC framework
    </li>
    <li><strong>Content-focused</strong> - between the <code>pails-content</code> plugin (and friends), the routing
        engine, and the object-relational mapping, everything in pails is focused on delivering content to the browser
        or other client as efficiently as possible</li>
    <li><strong>Fast</strong> - a by-product of minimalism, pails uses conventions to execute only the code it needs to
        for any given request...and that&#39;s without any additional caching.</li>
    <li><strong>Written in PHP</strong> - PHP is a very popular language for the web, so there are many existing hosting
        plans available that run pails out of the box. PHP as a language is also making great strides, so PHP is a great
        choice for implementation language</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable</strong> - pails is designed to be horizontally-scalable, making use of standard HTTP
        functionality and database-level optimizations, so adding another front-end server is free of complications.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unrestrictive</strong> - With very few exceptions, you can take an existing PHP web site, install pails
        on top of it, and retain the exact same experience. This means there is a clean upgrade path from any home-grown
        PHP site or app.</li>
    <li><strong>RAD-friendly</strong> - pails was designed specifically to enable the development of advanced sites and
        apps in as little time as possible. pails is also suitable for developing a live prototype; only a few tweaks
        should be necessary to make the prototype production-ready</li>
    <li><strong>Production ready</strong> - pails may be young, but it is in use in several production environments.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Need more proof? I&#39;d be happy to talk with you about why I made pails and why it&#39;s awesome (and better than
    Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, Rails, or any other platform out there).</p>

<h3>Distributions</h3>

<p>A distribution is a base pails app, plus a few plugins that work together for a very specific purpose. The
    terminology comes from the Drupal community, which I&#39;m sure came from the linux community. Here are the current
    distributions:</p>
