<h2>Hire me as a consultant</h2>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ll let you know what I think of your:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Business Idea</li>
    <li>Software Project</li>
    <li>Ability to scale</li>
    <li>Application security</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project is different, but I&#39;d love to chat with you about yours! The first email and phone call (usually
    between half an hour and an hour)&nbsp;is free, but please use the following process:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Fill out the form below, indicating which type of
        consultation you&#39;re after and describe your company or project in enough detail that I can prepare some
        questions to get a full, deep understanding of your company/project.</li>
    <li>I&#39;ll respond with a time I have available for a phone call (or Zoom meeting).</li>
    <li>During the meeting, I&#39;ll ask a lot of questions. If you don&#39;t know the answer, it&#39;s much better to
        say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; than to try to make up an answer (you&#39;ll get better and more applicable
        results from the consultation this way). Rest assured that any information provided during this meeting will
        remain confidential and only be used for your consultation. I may ask about the existence of Intellectual
        Property and its relevance to your competitive edge, but I won&#39;t ask details during this initial phone
        conversation.</li>
    <li>Once I&#39;ve finished asking questions, you&#39;ll have a chance to ask me about my professional background.
    </li>
    <li>To conclude the meeting, I&#39;ll lay out a list of items that are necessary to proceed (commonly, this includes
        things like access to source code and&nbsp;answers to some or all of the questions you answered &quot;I
        don&#39;t know&quot; to) and, if the terms are agreeable, the project proceeds according to your specific
        consulting needs.</li>
</ol>
