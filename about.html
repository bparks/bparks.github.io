</h2>

<p>
  I'm a software developer, systems architect, and problem-solver. My passion is
  to build software that empowers people to be the best versions of themselves
  and to enable those I work with to reach their full potential, and I'm excited
  by opportunities to design well-architected, scalable solutions. I'm currently
  a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://resolve.io/">Resolve Systems</a> and also have my own software startup,
  <a href="http://synapsesoftware.com/">Synapse Software</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I used to be pretty prolific on my
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuHkbG_j636LFHnsNyi8s8g/"
    >YouTube channel, Dev Parkour</a
  >. In the past, I've <a href="/blog">written about</a> my opinions and I used
  to have a <a href="http://synapsesoftware.com/podcast">podcast</a>, too. I
  also write open source software (but contribute to other projects far less
  than I'd like to), including
  <a href="http://github.com/bparks/pails">pails</a>, an insanely lightweight
  and minimalist MVC framework, CMS, and more for PHP, and
  <a href="https://github.com/bparks/libfmux">libfmux</a>, a small C library
  that efficiently multiplexes multiple "channels" over a single "link"
  (typically a socket, but it could easily be a pipe or file instead).
</p>

<p>
  Previously,
  I was a Software Engineering Manager at
  <a href="http://quantummetric.com">Quantum Metric</a> (Colorado Springs' first
  ever tech unicorn),
  a Senior Software Engineer at
  <a href="http://linquest.com">LinQuest Corporation</a> and (before that) at
  <a href="http://cherwell.com">Cherwell Software</a>, was the CTO of
  Picturebooth in the Colorado Springs (eventually HQ) office (and have since
  acquired the IP and internet presence for
  <a href="http://shutterpilot.com">ShutterPilot</a>), worked at
  <a href="http://www.younglife.org">Young Life</a> as what would normally be
  considered a full stack developer (though we didn't call it that), and was a
  graduate student at the
  <a href="http://www.uccs.edu/">University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</a>
  (where I worked in the
  <a href="http://vast.uccs.edu/">Vision and Security Technology (VAST) Lab</a>
  employing cortical models of vision to improve machine-based face
  recognition); obtained a B.S. in Computer Science from
  <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/">Lehigh University</a> in Bethlehem, PA (where
  I also worked as a Systems Administrator); and been involved in a few failed
  startups, including one in the GPS tracking space, another in the
  <a
    href="http://keithbnowak.com/post/55830173333/postmortem-of-my-first-company-a-reposting"
    >IM automation/mobile ordering space</a
  >, and my own custom software development company.
</p>

<p>
  I am a

  and a

    >Cherwell Certified Professional Designer</a
  > (both certifications are now expired, but with what I'm
  doing at <a href="http://synapsesoftware.com/">Synapse Software</a>,
  I probably know the concepts better than I ever have).
</p>

<p>
  On a couple occasions, I've worked with the UCCS
  <a href="http://innovation.uccs.edu">Bachelor of Innovation</a> program, and
  taught several courses (<a
    href="/uccs/"
    >archived here</a
  >) at UCCS, including the freshman-level programming course, the data
  structures course, computer organization and assembly, and object-oriented
  programming in C++.
</p>

<p>
  I'm involved in the
  <a href="https://bellingham.codes/">Bellingham Codes</a> community on Slack
  and occasionally in person as well and have been an instigator in the
  post-pandemic rejuvenation of <a href="http://blug.org/">
    Bellingham Linux Users Group (BLUG)
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  I was also the founding organizer of the
  <a href="http://cosprings.tech">Colorado Springs Tech (un)Conference</a>,
  which we hosted in-person in 2019 and virtually in 2020.
  I've stepped away since moving to Washington.
</p>

<p>
  I reside in Lynden, WA with my wife, <a href="http://saraparks.me">Sara</a>,
  where I enjoy hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, boating, fishing, and playing
  bass.
