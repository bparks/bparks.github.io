<p>There&#39;s a little-known variant of Murphy&#39;s Law that says &quot;Whenever a server goes down that absolutely needs to be brought back online immediately, it&#39;s inevitably the one that&#39;s accessible only via&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Text_terminals">serial console</a>&nbsp;and its only text editor is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)">ed</a>.&quot;</p>
