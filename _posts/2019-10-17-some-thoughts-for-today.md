<p>One thing I&#39;m trying to do more of is rather than responding to opinion or teachable-moment type things with a statement, formulating a question which will open the possibility to (what I think is) the right answer, or will at least lead to good discussion.</p>

<p>I also think I might start messaging a random person at work every week to set up half an hour to an hour of &quot;get to know you&quot; time just to help me feel more connected with other people at Cherwell and hopefully to help them feel more connected as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also currently reading Deep Work, so I&#39;m going to completely overhaul my schedule so (a) I&#39;m in control of it and (b) I have set-aside time for focused/deep work.</p>
