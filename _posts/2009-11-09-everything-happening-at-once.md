That's right, everything...

CVPR 2010 paper due Nov. 19th with the abstract due the 12th ...
Substance-Free Alumni Association forming ... winter coming &mdash; slowly ...
Christmas break approaching ... but mostly just the CVPR paper deadline.

I really don't have anything all that important to report other than the
paper's looking good and it'll be a relief when it's done. Then I can move on to
further research along the same lines, plus some other research tangent to it.
Eventually, my goal is to use the human visual system to develop a
blur/noise-invariant recognition system, or, at the very least, develop a robust
model for dealing with blur and noise prior to recognition. Should be fun.

Month isn't up yet, but I don't think the report card has changed much from a
few weeks ago.

October/beginning of November after the latest snowstorm from behind my
