title: brianparks.me is now a static site!

For many many reasons, I've decided to move my personal web site _off_ of being a `pails` app with PHP and into a static site constructed with Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages.

Some of the things previously linked to from the site (most notably the archive of my UCCS web site) will still need a home somewhere, which I haven't yet figured out, but I believe that link has been broken for a while so it's not a huge loss if it takes time before that's back up.

Who knows, I may even blog more...
