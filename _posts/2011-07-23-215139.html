This is the third time I&#39;ve made Jambalaya and so far the best. The first attempt was bland and severely lacking in Okra; the second was a little strong on the Okra and the vegetables ended up getting a little soggy.</p>
<p>
	Here&#39;s how it went down:</p>

<p>
	Dump it all into a pot. I started with the vegetables, then the meat, then the water and rice, and finally a few bay leaves (I used 4) and a fair amount of pepper. This is the next picture.</p>

This should take care of most of the liquid, but I may have had a little bit too much. Next time, I&#39;ll try decreasing the added water to 1 1/2 cups and add more if necessary (Photo 3).</p>
