title: More improvements to the blog
---

I added an RSS feed to the blog tonight while I listened to the Colorado
Avalanche live internet radio feed. They played the Edmonton Oilers and beat
them 3-0. But I digress...

The RSS feed is complete and seems to work with Apple's Mail.app RSS reader, so
I presume it will work in most other readers. Some of you might find it easier
to follow the blog now. However, as it is 11:17 my time, I am goign to cut this
post short and go to sleep. I may write a bit more tomorrow on what's happened
in the past week, but that all depends on how much time I have.
