title: So I lied...

Oh well.

Turns out that the snow wasn't as intense as predicted, so by the time I went up
to the lab, there was barely enough snow to ride through. Didn't stop me from
falling before I got out of the apartment complex parking lot, though. The lack
of clear roads combined with the low volume of traffic, coupled with the
just-above-freezing temperatures meant that the vehicle tracks were bare road
surrounded by wet snow that had partially frozen. In short, a bad place to try
to turn on a bike at slow speed.

That night (Wednesday) the same friend and I wandered down to the other end of
town for beer and music. On the way back, he ended up with a flat tire and had
to walk ~5 miles back to his apartment. He spent the next day sleeping and
fixing both that tire, which he'd taken home with him, and the other tire, which
he'd left at the lab and discovered was flat the next morning.

In other news, spring break is over, and I'm back in the swing of things. I have
a few semester project-type assignments due this week, plus an exam in one of my
two classes. I will be very happy when I don't have to deal with classes
anymore.
