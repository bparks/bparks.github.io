<p>So... I just got home from pitching the Picturebooth Social Wall at Colorado Springs New Tech with Ross Hill. The response was extremely positive and it&#39;s very exciting to get all the feedback we got.</p>

<p>We had a few slight hiccups with running the feed -- the main one being that apparently I set up a screensaver on my computer (a long long time ago) and totally forgot that I had. All in all, it was a pretty good first outing for the Social Wall amongst folks who have an eye and heart for entrepreneurship. Some good engagement, and some exciting pictures from the picturebooth we (Ross, actually)&nbsp;set up at the event.</p>
