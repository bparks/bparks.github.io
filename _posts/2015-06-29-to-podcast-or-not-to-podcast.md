<p>Well, it got to be about that time when I started to miss podcasting. More accurately, I started to miss rambling aimlessly about topic that I knew something about that listeners would listen to. I don&#39;t know if anyone has started to miss the podcast, but I feel it&#39;s time to revisit the format and give it a bit of a refresh.</p>

<p>So, I think it&#39;s going to be shorter. It&#39;ll just be me talking (no co-host), and I&#39;ll probably focus more on project management-type stuff. I&#39;m not doing that specifically these days, but I find it more interesting to be talking about than raw coding.</p>

<p>I am back&nbsp;at Young Life, so I&#39;m sure much of the podcast will revolve around thoughts inspired by my workday there. The schedule will likely be sporadic rather than regular, but hopefully I&#39;ll get into some sort of rhythm. And maybe they&#39;ll come with blogs, too.</p>

<p>I plan eventually to move things over here at some point and give the Synapse Software web site a bit of a refresh, too, specifically to preserve it in its current state, but in something a little bit lower maintenance than how it&#39;s currently supported.</p>
