<p>After a year and a half of (slowly) developing my PHP MVC framework&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/bparks/pails">pails</a>, complete with its plugin architecture, CMS framework, authentication system, and eventual plans to embrace the composer ecosystem, I&#39;m excited by some of the new things from the .NET community.</p>

<p>Specifically,</p>

<ul>
        <li>ASP.Net vNext:&nbsp;http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html</li>
        <li>Things like ReactJS.NET:&nbsp;http://reactjs.net/</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ll have to see. I&#39;ll update after I&#39;ve written an app using these technologies.</p>
