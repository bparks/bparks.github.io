<p>Since the downsizing and restructuring of Synapse Software, I&#39;m sure many readers are wondering what the next chapter in my life will be. Will I get a day job? Will I start going on a lecture circuit? Will I focus on my side projects? Will I ever do another startup?</p>

<p>I think the best way to answer these questions is in reverse, because that&#39;s kind of how I&#39;ve been thinking about them. Running Synapse Software for the past 10 months (and on the larger scale, the past 5 years) has been an incredible experience. I&#39;ve learned quite a bit, some of which I&#39;ll share in future blog posts.</p>

<h3>Will I ever do another startup?</h3>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>By that I mean (a) not one of my own design, (b) not one where there is a significant amount of uncertainty or risk, and (c) not one where I need it to succeed in order to continue to have a paycheck.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I will never again have businesses that make money. I certainly already have side projects that I am making available for paying&nbsp;customers (<a href="http://dudl.me">dudl</a>, <a href="http://neomsg.com">neomsg</a>) and others that may evolve into services that are worth paying for (<a href="http://klipr.us">klipr</a>) and I&#39;m sure there will be no end to those.</p>

<p>Another option would be building a company around web development on <a href="https://github.com/bparks/pails">pails</a>, the same way that e.g. Acquia has built itself around Drupal development,&nbsp;though that gets way too close to the startup thing I&#39;ve just left.</p>

<h3>Will I focus on my side projects?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Right now, I&#39;m focusing the most on pails (ironic, because I know I&#39;m not likely going to build a business around using pails to solve client problems). The initial goal was to get the <code>pails-content</code> and <code>pails-blog</code> modules up and running so that I could use them on this site, but I know there&#39;s potential beyond that and I&#39;ve even had to resort to putting together a <a href="https://github.com/bparks/pails-plugins/blob/master/plugin-requests">plugin-requests</a> page just so I can remember all the functionality I want to add.</p>

<p>I also plan to pick at dudl every once in a while to keep the community going and try to build a modest revenue stream. I think it&#39;s a useful web design tool and I want to keep improving it based on my own experience and user feedback.</p>

<p>klipr and neomsg are more back-burner right now. I think klipr is great as-is, but I don&#39;t want it to necessarily stay there. neomsg, on the other hand, hasn&#39;t been pitched to the right people to get any good traction, but I&#39;m sure it will stay relevant for at least the next few years.</p>

<h3>Will I start going on a lecture circuit?</h3>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s no secret that I enjoy talking. Especially when I have something worth talking <em>about</em>. I currently have two talks I&#39;ve been honing: one on intentional web architecture (inspired by my experiences writing pails) and another on &quot;the modern semantic web&quot; and the use of Javascript to utilize the Web as a giant, distributed database.</p>

<p>To answer the question, I probably won&#39;t go on too extensive a &quot;circuit&quot;, but I do plan to do talks around town and possibly at select conferences with topics that pique my interest.</p>

<h3>Will I get a day job?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I will refrain from adding more detail until there are more concrete plans, but the plan is to get a day job at a company or organization where I enjoy not only the work, but what the company as a whole does. If that happens, everything listed above should just fall into place.</p>
