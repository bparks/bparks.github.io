title: Colorado Rainstorm 2011

<p>
	Colorado only has one significant rainstorm every year. Sure, we have the occasional afternoon shower, but only once a year does it&nbsp;<strong>pour</strong>. This year&#39;s happened last Wednesday, September 14th. Here&#39;s what the drainage ditch behind my apartment looked like (that&#39;s not a canal):</p>

	Today, this is what the bridge just upstream looked like:</p>

<p>
	Er...wait. Maybe this one?</p>

	Actually, both are of the bridge...or where the bridge used to be. Seems that the flooding caused some damage to the bridge, so they had to remove it. Signs on either side say that the bridge will return in June 2012. The picture below shows the view down the gap toward Pike&#39;s Peak and Garden of the Gods.</p>
