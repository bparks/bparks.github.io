<p>I just won an Apple Watch (Series 4) from a contest at Cherwell Software, but I don&#39;t use an iPhone as my primary phone. This blog post is the first in what will be a series of blog posts about how effectively I can use an Apple Watch with or in spite of my Android Phone.</p>

<p>Recently&nbsp;my primary phone is a Samsung Galaxy S8 and I&#39;ve worn a Fitbit (secondhand and&nbsp;free) for the past year. Primarily, I use it to track steps and sleep. I don&#39;t do particularly intense exercise or sports, so the Fitbit&#39;s been a glorified pedometer and sleep tracker. The Apple Watch tracks steps natively, but to track sleep the way I have been on the Fitbit requires a separate app, like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pillow-automatic-sleep-tracker/id878691772?mt=8">Pillow</a>. At least for now, I&#39;ll test out Pillow and see how it compares to the Fitbit.</p>

<p>Another thing I&#39;m curious about is the charging schedule I&#39;ll need to use. This was something I was concerned about when I started using the Fitbit as well, because most people seem to charge things while they sleep, but sleep is one of the things I track. Instead, I&#39;ve typically charged the Fitbit while I watch TV in the evenings or while I work on side projects -- some point in time when I&#39;m fairly sedentary so I&#39;m not missing out on valuable data. The Fitbit only needed to be charged approximately once a week, so it was only a periodic inconvenience. Hopefully the Apple Watch will live up to the high bar the Fitbit has set.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ll be curious to see if there&#39;s&nbsp;<em>any way at all</em>&nbsp;I can manage the Apple Watch from my Android phone. I&#39;m not holding my breath on this one, given the general lack of interoperability between the two ecosystems, but that won&#39;t stop me from looking anyway.</p>
