That's right. I got a car today. It's a 2007 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited or some
nonsense like that. It was a great deal at just over 50,000 miles. It even still
has that new car smell. It handles quite nicely, especially compared to the '94
Ford Escort Wagon that I'd been driving up until it died last October or
November.

In other news, I've spent two more days (the past two fridays) up in Denver
doing some neuroscience research. Two fridays ago I helped finish up a paper, on
which I now have my name (I'll post links when I find the final copy). Last
friday, I started working on my independent study project, beginning with a
literature search of classification-based methods of epileptic seizure
prediction from EEG data. I expect I'll be back in Denver Thursday (and probably
also Friday) continuing to read the articles I've found and possibly beginning
the code base that will become my classifier.

As far as the less exciting aspects of my academic career are concerned, I have
passed the Ph. D. Qualifying exams (surprise, surprise) and I have successfully
finished two semesters of classes (boring, boring classes).
