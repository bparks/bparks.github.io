title: Why don't people read/write documentation?
---

The biggest reasons I see documents people write that don't get read are (in order):
1. there is a culture of "ask first, document never" (i.e. tribal knowledge)
2. the document is not discoverable
3. the document is too long
4. people don't know why they should read the document
5. the document has too many "branches" (if x, then y)
6. the document is out of date (_sigh_)
