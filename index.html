</h2>

<p>I'm a software developer, systems architect, and problem-solver. My passion is to build software that empowers people
    to be the best versions of themselves and to enable those I work with to reach their full potential, and Iâ€™m
    excited by opportunities to design well-architected, scalable solutions. I'm currently able to do all that as a
    Software Engineering Manager at <a href="http://quantummetric.com">Quantum Metric</a>, Colorado Springs' first ever
    tech unicorn!</p>

<p>I'm pretty prolific on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuHkbG_j636LFHnsNyi8s8g/">YouTube channel, Dev
        Parkour</a>. In the past, I'veÂ <a href="/blog">writtenÂ about</a>Â my opinions and I used to have aÂ <a
        href="http://synapsesoftware.com/podcast">podcast</a>, too.Â I also write open source software (but contribute
    to other projects far less than I'd like to), including <a href="http://github.com/bparks/pails">pails</a>, an
    insanely lightweight and minimalist MVC framework, CMS, and moreÂ for PHP (this site is built using pails), and <a
        href="https://github.com/bparks/libfmux">libfmux</a>, a small C library that efficiently multiplexes multiple
    "channels" over a single "link" (typically a socket, but it could easily be a pipe or file instead).</p>

<p>I also work on a few side projects:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://shutterpilot.com">ShutterPilot</a> - Photo booth software for people who want to be able to
        sleep well at night</li>
    <li><a href="http://demo.glassminnow.com/session/login">Glassminnow</a> - An order management system (OMS) that I'm
        restoring on my YouTube channel</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/bparks/yade">Yade</a> - A MySQL-compatible interface on top of YAML files for use
        with CMSes like Wordpress</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://linquest.com">LinQuest Corporation</a>, and
    (before that) at <a href="http://cherwell.com">Cherwell Software</a>, was the CTO ofÂ PictureboothÂ in theÂ Colorado
    Springs (eventually HQ) office (and have since acquired the IP and internet presence for <a
        href="http://shutterpilot.com">ShutterPilot</a>), worked atÂ <a href="http://www.younglife.org">Young
        Life</a>Â as what would normally be considered a full stack developerÂ (though we didn't call it that), and
    wasÂ a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.uccs.edu/">University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</a> (where
    I worked in the <a href="http://vast.uccs.edu/">Vision and Security Technology (VAST) Lab</a> employing cortical
    models of vision to improve machine-based face recognition); obtained a B.S. in Computer Science from <a
        href="http://www.lehigh.edu/">Lehigh University</a> in Bethlehem, PA (where I also worked as a Systems
    Administrator); and been involved in a few failed startups, including one in the GPS tracking space, another in the
    <a href="http://keithbnowak.com/post/55830173333/postmortem-of-my-first-company-a-reposting">IM automation/mobile
        ordering space</a>, and my own custom software development company, <a
        href="http://synapsesoftware.com/">Synapse Software</a>Â (twice).</p>

<p>I am aÂ <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/af5f3e37-c043-4b41-9bec-c9d89f34c468/public_url">Cherwell
        Certified ProfessionalÂ Administrator</a>Â and aÂ <a
        href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/a8660009-7e33-4e94-b9f4-80adf495d470/public_url">Cherwell Certified
        Professional Designer</a>.</p>

<p>On a couple occasions, I've worked with the UCCS <a href="http://innovation.uccs.edu">Bachelor of Innovation</a>
    program, and <a href="http://cs.uccs.edu/~bparks/">taught several courses</a> (<a href="/uccs/">archived here</a>)
    at UCCS, including the freshman-level programming course, the data structures course, computer organization and
    assembly, and object-oriented programming in C++.</p>

<p>I'm involved in the <a href="https://bellingham.codes/">Bellingham Codes</a>Â community on Slack and am in the
    process of moving, so I anticipate being involved in person as well.</p>

<p>I'm also the foundingÂ organizer of the <a href="http://cosprings.tech">Colorado Springs Tech (un)Conference</a>,
    though I've stepped away due to my upcoming move.</p>

<p>I reside in Colorado Springs, CO with my wife, <a href="http://saraparks.me">Sara</a>, where I enjoy hiking,
    cross-country skiing, and playing bass.</p>
