<h2>(Partial) list of things I've done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://synapsesoftware.com">Synapse Software</a> - I'm building no-code
    development tools for IT and business process automation. It's like an
    integration platform mixed with a reporting platform: it connects with other
    systems really easily and provides a UI where you can also see and manipulate the
    data, not just shuttle it from one system to another.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://valencedev.io">Valence</a> - A single pane of glass for
    Product Managers to organize all their information and report on everything
    they have going on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://shutterpilot.com">ShutterPilot</a> - Digital and social
    photo booth software for remote kiosks that's 100% cloud-controlled.
  </li>
</ul>
